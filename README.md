# Full Stack Compliance Dashboard

This project is a full-stack application designed to monitor and track the conformity progress of multiple LLM-based systems, providing detailed evaluation results. It combines a React-based frontend, a Node.js/Express API backend, and a MySQL database, all containerized for seamless deployment.

---

## Architecture & Technology Stack

### 1. **Frontend (React + TypeScript)**

- **React.js**: For building a dynamic and responsive interface.
- **React Admin**: Enables rapid development of admin dashboards.
- **Recharts**: Used for displaying visual data insights, such as pie and bar charts.

### 2. **Backend (Node.js/Express + TypeScript)**

- **Node.js**: Executes server-side logic.
- **Express**: Provides robust routing and API logic.
- **Prisma ORM**: Handles database interactions, migrations, and schema management.

### 3. **Database (MySQL)**

- **MySQL**: Stores system and evaluation data.
- **Prisma**: Ensures efficient and reliable database access and management.

### 4. **Containerization (Docker & Docker Compose)**

- **Docker**: Packages the frontend, API, and MySQL database into isolated containers.
- **Docker Compose**: Manages multi-container applications, networking, and volumes.

### 5. **Testing Tools**

> No testing has been coded, but the API project has been designed with testability in mind, adhering to principles of low coupling and high cohesion, enabling dependency injection and mocking for comprehensive testing.

- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests.
- **Testing Library**: For simulating real user interactions with React components.

### 6. **Code Quality Tools**

- **ESLint**: Detects potential issues in the code.
- **Prettier**: Ensures consistent formatting across the codebase.

## Front-end Dashboard Views

### Main (Dashboard's Home) View

The main dashboard view shows a list of the top 10 performing projects in a bar chart. The chart displays the conformity progress of each project, allowing users to compare the progress visually.

Tapping on a project will navigate to the project's view.

> It also includes a link to the _API test_ view, which displays a simple _hello world_ message from the API if that service is running and accessible.

### Projects List View

A list of all projects is displayed in a table format, showing the project name, type and conformity progress. Users can click on a project to view detailed evaluation results for that project.

> The list can be exported to a CSV file by clicking on the export button.

> The items can be selected and deleted by clicking on the delete button.

### Project View

The page displays the project's name and type alongisde a visual representation of the conformity progress with a pie chart with a needle pointing to the current progress.

In addition, a list of the distincts evaluations performed to the project are displayed, sorted by score, with a pie chart with a needle pointing to the evaluation's score and showing the evaluation's system and dataset.

> Tapping on an evaluation will navigate to the evaluation's view.

### Evaluations List View

A list of all evaluations is displayed in a table format, showing the project they are related to, system, dataset, score, and other metrics (accuracy, relevancy, helpfulness, and toxicity). Users can click on an evaluation to view detailed evaluation results for that system in the Evaluation View.

> The list can be exported to a CSV file by clicking on the export button.

> The items can be selected and deleted by clicking on the delete button.

### Evaluation View

The page displays the evaluation's project, system, dataset, score, and other metrics (accuracy, relevancy, helpfulness, and toxicity) alongside a visual representation of the different performance of the distinct metrics in a radar chart.

### Edit views

From within the project list view, project view, evaluation list view, and evaluation view, users can edit the project and evaluation data by clicking on the edit button. This will open a form to edit the data.

> A delete button is also available to delete the project or evaluation.

### Create views

From within the project list view, and evaluation list view, users can create new projects and evaluations by clicking on the create button. This will open a form to create new data.

## Data Flow

The **frontend** communicates with the **backend** via RESTful APIs to fetch and update data.

- React Admin uses a **dataProvider** abstraction for API calls, mapping resources (e.g., projects, evaluations) to endpoints.
- Backend layers include:
  - **Router**: Handles HTTP requests and forwards them to services.
  - **Service**: Contains business logic for processing requests.
  - **Repository**: Interfaces with the Prisma ORM for database access.

---

## Docker Configuration

The project is containerized for both development and production.

### Development

- **Frontend**: Served on `http://localhost:3000`.
- **Backend**: Available at `http://localhost:3001`.
- **Database**: MySQL accessible at `localhost:3306`.

> The development uses the .env files to configure the services.

### Production

- Deployed using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** services like **Cloud Run** and **Cloud SQL**.

> The production configuration is set up in .YAML files for the services in the cloud.

---

## Database Migrations

Database migrations ensure schema changes are consistently applied.

### Creating a New Migration

1. **Update the Prisma schema** in `api/prisma/schema.prisma`.
2. **Access the API container**:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container_id> sh
   ```

   > Replace `<container_id>` with the ID of the API container found running `docker ps`.

3. Navigate to the app directory:

   ```bash
   cd /app
   ```

4. Create the migration:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>
   ```

   > Replace `<migration_name>` with a descriptive name for the migration.

5. Deploy the migration:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

6. Regenerate the Prisma client:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

> This ensures the Prisma client reflects the latest schema changes.
